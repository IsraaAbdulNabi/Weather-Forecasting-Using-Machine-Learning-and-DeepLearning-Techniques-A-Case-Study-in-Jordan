# Weather-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning-and-DeepLearning-Techniques-A-Case-Study-in-Jordan

This work is done to our term paper for the CIs726-DATA EXPLORATION AND VISUALIZATION course. 

In this work, we present a case study on three different cities of Amman, Irbid, and Aqaba in Jordan and propose different methods to utilize the cities historical weather data over 13 years to predict the average temperature.

You can find and access the dataset on Kaggel, under the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/israa95/historical-weather-data-for-jordan

We combine these data and use them for training a set of classic machine learning models and deep recurrent neural networks consists of two layers of BiLSTM and an output dense layer.
The proposed models can be run on low-cost and less resource-intensive computing systems, yet they provide quick and reliable weather forecasts to be used in our day-to-day life.

The attached code can be run using google colab. First download the dataset from Kaggle, as it mentioned in the link above, then download the "Weather_Forecasting_using_ML_and_DL.ipynb" file, open it using google colab and upload the "weather_data_24hr.csv" file. You can run the code cell by cell to explore our analysis study.
